COMPANY BRIEFING (shared by all roles; fictional company, working assumptions for the simulation)

GadgetBox is a Polish online store selling small electronics and accessories: headphones and audio,
chargers and power banks, cables and adapters, smartwatches and wearables, speakers, computer
accessories, smartphone accessories, smart-home gadgets and gaming accessories.
Scale: about 2,300 products in 9 categories from about 34 brands. About 35 employees.

Sales: own online store (about 60% of orders) and marketplaces, mainly Allegro and also Amazon
(about 40%). Customers are individuals (B2C) and companies (about 15% of orders are B2B). The data
covers the last 24 months, roughly 4,500 orders per month on average, and more than a million tracked
website events (page views, product views, add-to-cart, checkout, payment).

Operations: two warehouses (warehouse A handles most shipments, warehouse B is small and handles
overflow and B2B orders). Deliveries by two courier companies and one parcel-locker network.
An order can be shipped in several parcels.

Systems (data is spread over them, nothing is integrated):
- shop platform: orders, order lines, customers, carts
- marketplace panels: marketplace orders and payouts
- web analytics: sessions and events (JSON exports)
- ERP/WMS: daily stock levels, purchases from suppliers, purchase prices (CSV exports)
- carrier APIs: shipment statuses
- returns and complaints system (RMA)
- marketing tools: campaign costs and newsletter
- customer reviews

Management problem: nobody knows which products and channels are really profitable after delivery
costs, returns and advertising, and how to reduce stockouts and overstock. Figures from different
systems do not match.

The student team is building an analytics solution: data warehouse, KPIs, dashboards and reports,
and is interviewing employees to collect requirements.
